# Cuts release vX.Y.Z of brindex-ingest from the owner's machine. release.yml only publishes a tag that is
# on main AND equals `version` in pyproject.toml, and a failed run after the tag is public means
# tagging a new patch (a published tag is never moved). So this does the steps in the only order
# that works: check main is clean and current, set the version, commit and tag locally, then push
# main and the tag together (the tag is what starts release.yml).
#
#   scripts/release.sh patch              # or minor, major: bumps the current version
#   scripts/release.sh 1.2.3              # an explicit X.Y.Z
#   scripts/release.sh --dry-run minor    # runs the checks and prints the plan; changes nothing
#
# Nothing is written, committed or pushed until you type the tag at the prompt. If the version was
# already bumped (say, in a merged PR), pass that same version and it only tags. A version below the
# current one or the latest release is refused, and so is an existing tag: moving a tag stays a
# decision taken by hand.
